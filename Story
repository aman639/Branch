RABIT AND EARTHWORM

One day a rabbit was boasting about how fast he could run. He was laughing at the earthworm for being so slow. Much to the rabbit’s surprise, the earthworm challenged him to a race. The rabbit thought this was a good joke and accepted the challenge. The fox was to be the umpire of the race. As the race began, the rabbit raced way ahead of the earthworm, just like everyone thought.

The rabbit got to the halfway point and could not see the earthworm anywhere. He was hot and tired and decided to stop and take a short nap. Even if the earthworm passed him, he would be able to race to the finish line ahead of him. All this time the earthworm kept walking step by step by step. He never quit no matter how hot or tired he got. He just kept going.
